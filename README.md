# Questions and Answers API Read Me

## Overview

Given a legacy front end for an E-Commerce storefront my team and I were tasked to redesign the backend in such a way that it could handle web-scale traffic. Due to the setup of the product page the backend APIs were divided into three sections: Overview and Related Products, Ratings and Reviews, and Questions and Answers. I was responsible for the Questions and Answers section. The other members apart of this team was [Eric Hernandez](https://github.com/EricMHernandez) who was in charge of the Overview and Related Products section as well as [John Kwak](https://github.com/johnkwak08) who was responsible for the Ratings and Reviews section.
